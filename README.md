I have created five programs with basic html, css and javascript.
The 5 webpages are 
    1. age to days converter (challenge 1).
    2. image generator (challenge 2).
    3. color button generator (challenge 4).
    4. Rock Paper Scissor game ( challenge 3).

#Age to day converter:
        The Age to day converter have two button one for getting your age and one for reset the App. When you click on the age button it will give you an alert asking you age one you click 'ok' it will return the number of days. Then using the reset button you can restart the app.
        
#image generator:
        The image generator contains two button Generate and Remove. When you click on the Generate button it will display the image you have linked. The image generated will be equivalent to the number of times you have clicked the Generate Button. Then using the remove button you can remove the image one by one.
